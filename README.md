# FAQ

## How do I contact you?

If we haven't already spoken, please call me. My number is [+61 415 658 257](tel:+61415658257).

My email address is john\[at\]coruscade\[.\]com.

## What is your availability?

I can work for you for 4 days a week, from Tuesday to Friday.

I am a life-long contractor. I am not looking for a permanent role.

## Can I do \[anything\] to this document?

No. This document directly represents who I am. Please don't change it.

I am happy to create a version for you. Perhaps you want your logo on it, or you want a version without my contact details. That's cool. Get in touch.

## May I have this as a Word document?

No. :-)

I'm not being awkward[^awk], there just isn't a Word version. The [master](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnydecimal/resume/main/resume.md) is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which GitHub then makes look nice. The PDF was created from the Markdown using [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com).

I strongly believe in the concept of [separating content from presentation](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=content+vs+presentation+html+css), which is one of the reasons I prefer not to use Word.

As per the note [above](https://github.com/johnnydecimal/resume/blob/main/README.md#can-i-do-anything-to-this-document), you may not copy/paste this content in to a Word document.
